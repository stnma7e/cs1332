for non-negative edges

priority queues: priority by edge weights
hashmap: keep edge weights stored

starting with A:
add (A, 0) to map
add A's neighbors to priority queue with edge weights
dequeue first thing in queue
    add the edge you dequeued to the hashmap with the total weight it takes to get there
    add it's neighbors to queue with edge weights plus the weight it took to get to the current node
        this is stored in the hashmap
